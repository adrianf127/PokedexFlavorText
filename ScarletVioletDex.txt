Scarlet: Its orange flowers fire off powerful beams, attacking as if they were a battery of artillery.
Violet: In times long past, castle governors would lovingly raise Florges to care for their castlesÕ exquisite gardens.

Florges (Blue Flower)
Scarlet: Though usually compassionate, Florges will hunt down anyone who vandalizes its flower garden, showing no mercy even if they beg for their lives.
Violet: Blue pigments were tremendously expensive in the past, so paintings of blue Florges are highly valuable.

Florges (White Flower)
Scarlet: A flower garden made by a white-flowered Florges will be beautifully decorated with flowering plants of many different colors.
Violet: A Florges adorned with white flowers can sync with the wavelengths of various colors to draw forth their power.

Skiddo
Scarlet: Until recently, people living in the mountains would ride on the backs of these PokŽmon to traverse the mountain paths.
Violet: As long as it has sunlight and water, Skiddo can make energy with the leaves on its body, allowing it to live on rocky mountains barren of food.

Gogoat
Scarlet: It can sense the feelings of others by touching them with its horns. This species has assisted people with their work since 5,000 years ago.
Violet: These PokŽmon live in herds in mountainous places. The victor in their contests of clashing horns will become the leader of the herd.

Skrelp
Scarlet: Skrelp evades its enemies by hiding amid drifting seaweed. It eats rotten seaweed to create its poison.
Violet: This PokŽmon is a poor swimmer. If itÕs caught in a fierce storm, it will sometimes get washed far away and become unable to return to its home.

Dragalge
Scarlet: Using a liquid poison, Dragalge indiscriminately attacks anything that wanders into its territory. This poison can corrode the undersides of boats.
Violet: Since Finizen is the better swimmer, Dragalge will approach it under the cover of seaweed, then immobilize it with a poisonous attack.

Clauncher
Scarlet: This PokŽmon launches water by detonating gas inside its right claw. It snipes flying PokŽmon.
Violet: ClauncherÕs claws will regrow if they fall off. The meat inside the claws is edible, but it has a distinct flavor that doesnÕt appeal to all tastes.

Clawitzer
Scarlet: Clawitzer can move through the water at a speed of 60 knots by using gas inside its body to expel water from the back of its claw.
Violet: The cannonballs of seawater that Clawitzer launches from its claw are powerful enough to punch through tanker hulls.

Sylveon
Scarlet: This PokŽmon uses its ribbonlike feelers to send a soothing aura into its opponents, erasing their hostility.
Violet: Sylveon cuts an elegant figure as it dances lightly around, feelers fluttering, but its piercing moves aim straight for its opponentsÕ weak spots.

Hawlucha
Scarlet: Its elegant finishing movesÑperformed by nimbly leaping around using its wingsÑare polished in the forest where it was born and raised.
Violet: Hawlucha live quietly without flocking together. They fight constantly with their natural enemies: noisy groups of Primeape.

Dedenne
Scarlet: ItÕs small and its electricity-generating organ is not fully developed, so it uses its tail to absorb electricity from peopleÕs homes and charge itself.
Violet: Dedenne emit electrical waves from the whiskers on their cheeks to communicate with each other. When low on electricity, they curl up and sleep.

Goomy
Scarlet: Most of a GoomyÕs body is water. A membrane covers the whole PokŽmon to prevent it from shriveling up in dry weather.
Violet: GoomyÕs horns are excellent sensory organs that cover all five of GoomyÕs senses. Goomy picks up on danger from the movement of the air.

Sliggoo
Scarlet: The swirly protrusion on its back is filled with all its vital organs, such as its brain and heart.
Violet: When Sliggoo senses danger, the mucus coating its entire body becomes more concentratedÑ itÕll dissolve anything.

Goodra
Scarlet: It loves the rain. This mellow PokŽmon can be seen walking around on the plains and in the mountains on rainy days.
Violet: This PokŽmon is uncontrollable when enraged. It rampages on and on, lashing its tail with enough power to send a dump truck flying.

Klefki
Scarlet: Once it absorbs a keyÕs metal ions, it discards the key without a second thought. However, it will hang on to keys it favors for decades.
Violet: In the past, noble families entrusted their vault keys to a Klefki. They passed the Klefki down through the generations, taking good care of it.

Bergmite
Scarlet: They live in mountainous regions of frigid cold. On rare occasions, they ride on the back of an Avalugg to cross seas and move to new habitats.
Violet: Bergmite protects itself by coating its body in ice formed by frigid air of ?148 degrees Fahrenheit. It fights with Frigibax whenever they meet.

Avalugg
Scarlet: As Avalugg walks along with Bergmite on its back, it comes across pods of Cetitan. It lets them pass to avoid conflict.
Violet: This PokŽmon uses its massive icy body to flatten anything that gets in its way. When itÕs floating out on the ocean, it looks exactly like drift ice.

Noibat
Scarlet: This PokŽmon emits ultrasonic waves from its large ears to search for fruit to eat. It mistakes Applin for its food.
Violet: Noibat can change the frequency of its sound waves at will, and it generates ultrasonic waves of up to 200,000 hertz.

Noivern
Scarlet: Ultrasonic waves emitted by a Noivern can pulverize a large boulder. This PokŽmon has a cruel disposition.
Violet: In the dark, even Hydreigon are terrified of this PokŽmon. But in the light, Noivern is the one that avoids battle.

Yungoos
Scarlet: Its stomach fills most of its torso. It wanders the same path every day, searching for fresh food.
Violet: It spends its waking hours searching endlessly for food. When Yungoos is hungry, its ferocity gains a certain edge.

Gumshoos
Scarlet: Once it finds signs of prey, it will patiently stake out the location, waiting until the sun goes down.
Violet: Gumshoos specializes in relentlessly tracking down prey. The simple-minded Skwovet doesnÕt seem to provide Gumshoos enough challenge.

Crabrawler
Scarlet: This PokŽmon punches trees and eats the berries that drop down, training itself and getting food at the same time.
Violet: If it loses its pincers, theyÕll quickly regrow. The pincers are popular ingredients in paella since their shells produce a tasty soup stock.

Crabominable
Scarlet: The detached pincers of these PokŽmon are delicious. Some Trainers bring Lechonk into the mountains just to search for them.
Violet: Though its punches are powerful, this PokŽmonÕs movements are sluggish. It blows icy bubbles from its mouth to immobilize its opponents.

Oricorio (Baile Style)
Scarlet: This PokŽmon is incredibly popular, possibly because its passionate dancing is a great match with the temperament of Paldean people.
Violet: This form of Oricorio has sipped red nectar. It whips up blazing flames as it moves to the steps of its passionate dance.

Oricorio (Pom-Pom Style)
Scarlet: This form of Oricorio has sipped yellow nectar. It uses nimble steps to approach opponents, then knocks them out with electric punches.
Violet: The energetic, cheerful dance of these Oricorio is popular with children, but the Oricorio themselves are hard to find in Paldea.

Oricorio (PaÕu Style)
Scarlet: The airy dance of these Oricorio is popular as a means of maintaining good health, but the Oricorio themselves are hard to find in Paldea.
Violet: This form of Oricorio has sipped pink nectar. It elevates its mind with the gentle steps of its dance, then unleashes its psychic energy.

Oricorio (Sensu Style)
Scarlet: This form of Oricorio has sipped purple nectar. It uses ethereal dance steps to call forth the spirits of the dead.
Violet: The elegant, attractive dance of these Oricorio is popular with adults, but the Oricorio themselves are hard to find in Paldea.

Rockruff
Scarlet: This PokŽmon is very friendly when itÕs young. Its disposition becomes vicious once it matures, but it never forgets the kindness of its master.
Violet: This PokŽmon travels in a pack with others until it grows up. When its mood turns sour, it starts striking the ground with the rocks on its neck.

Lycanroc (Midday Form)
Scarlet: Lycanroc attacks its prey with its sharp claws and fangs. It loyally obeys the instructions of a Trainer it trusts.
Violet: It has a calm and collected demeanor. It swiftly closes in on its prey, then slices them with the rocks in its mane.

Lycanroc (Midnight Form)
Scarlet: This PokŽmon uses its rocky mane to slash any who approach. It will even disobey its Trainer if it dislikes the orders it was given.
Violet: This Lycanroc has an extremely vicious temperament. It will happily sustain injuries for the sake of taking down its opponent.

Lycanroc (Dusk Form)
Scarlet: Normally this PokŽmon doesnÕt even bark, but once it enters battle, it will relentlessly drive the opponent into a corner.
Violet: These PokŽmon have both calm and ferocious qualities. ItÕs said that this form of Lycanroc is the most troublesome to raise.

Mareanie
Scarlet: This PokŽmon wanders the seaside looking for food. It often gets electric shocks from broken Pincurchin spines that it tries to eat.
Violet: It has excellent regenerative capabilities. Legs that a Mareanie has lost have a very bitter, astringent flavorÑtheyÕre not suitable as food.

Toxapex
Scarlet: This PokŽmon lives within a dome made by its own legs. Toxapex monitors its surroundings by sensing the flow of the tide through its spikes.
Violet: Toxapex gets into fierce battles with Bruxish over areas where warm ocean currents flow, but the odds are always against it.

Mudbray
Scarlet: This PokŽmon covers itself in mud that it has regurgitated. The mud wonÕt dry out even if itÕs exposed to the sun for a long time.
Violet: Though a slow walker, Mudbray is plenty strong. Its pace doesnÕt change even when itÕs loaded with 50 times its own body weight.

Mudsdale
Scarlet: This PokŽmon has been treasured not just for its physical labor but also because it produces high-quality mud used for making pottery.
Violet: Its legs are fortified with mud and harder than stone, and they can reduce a large truck to scrap with one kick.

Fomantis
Scarlet: Fomantis hates having its naps interrupted. It fires off beams using energy it gathers by bathing in the sun.
Violet: Many Trainers give their Fomantis their own flowerpots so they can sunbathe in peace and quiet.

Lurantis
Scarlet: By masquerading as a bug PokŽmon, it lowers the guard of actual bug PokŽmon lured in by a scent of sweet flowers. Its sickles bring them down.
Violet: A lot of time and effort is required to maintain the vivid colors of its petals. This PokŽmon puts its TrainerÕs attentiveness to the test.

Salandit
Scarlet: It taunts its prey and lures them into narrow, rocky areas where it then sprays them with toxic gas to make them dizzy and take them down.
Violet: Only female Salandit can produce gas laden with pheromones. Males entranced by this gas will do whatever the females tell them.

Salazzle
Scarlet: Salazzle makes its opponents light-headed with poisonous gas, then captivates them with alluring movements to turn them into loyal servants.
Violet: When two Salazzle meet, they will use their pheromone gas to fight over the males in each otherÕs group.

Bounsweet
Scarlet: Its sweat is sweet, like syrup made from boiled-down fruit. Because of this, Bounsweet was highly valued in the past, when sweeteners were scarce.
Violet: A Greedent drawn in by the sweet scent of these PokŽmon will tuck the Bounsweet in among the berries in its tail and carry them all away.

Steenee
Scarlet: Steenee spreads a sweet scent that makes others feel invigorated. This same scent is popular for antiperspirants.
Violet: Steenee bounces energetically through forests. If the rind that peels off its body is pulverized, it can be used to treat stomach pains.

Tsareena
Scarlet: This PokŽmon is proud and aggressive. However, it is said that a Tsareena will instantly become calm if someone touches the crown on its calyx.
Violet: This PokŽmon launches fierce yet elegant kicks with its long, slender legs. It views Quaquaval as its rival.

Oranguru
Scarlet: People used to mistake Oranguru for a human when they saw it issue command after command to the other PokŽmon of the forest.
Violet: This PokŽmon lives quietly in the depths of the forest. The purple, cape-like fur gets longer and longer as Oranguru ages.

Passimian
Scarlet: This PokŽmon battles by throwing hard berries. It wonÕt obey a Trainer who throws PokŽ Balls without skill.
Violet: The boss chooses 10 members of the group to go out hunting. The hunting party will evenly split the food they find with the rest of the group.

Sandygast
Scarlet: If it loses its shovel, it will stick something elseÑ like a branchÑin its head to make do until it finds another shovel.
Violet: It flings sand into the eyes of its prey and tries to close in on them while theyÕre blinded, but since Sandygast is so slow, the prey tends to escape.

Palossand
Scarlet: The terrifying Palossand drags smaller PokŽmon into its sandy body. Once its victims are trapped, it drains them of their vitality whenever it pleases.
Violet: From the hollows in its arms, it fires the bones of its victims, which are all dried up after being drained of their vitality.

Komala
Scarlet: Komala spends its entire life sleeping. It feeds on leaves that contain a potent poison only Komala can break down.
Violet: A potent anesthetic can be made by diluting KomalaÕs drool. This anesthetic was used for surgeries in the past.

Mimikyu (Disguised Form)
Scarlet: This PokŽmon lives in dark places untouched by sunlight. When it appears before humans, it hides itself under a cloth that resembles a Pikachu.
Violet: Mimikyu was only recently identified as a PokŽmon. Previously, people thought it was just a ghost wearing a cloth.

Mimikyu (Busted Form)
Scarlet: Even as it struggles beneath the cloth to repair the broken neck of its disguise, Mimikyu keeps up its impersonation of Pikachu.
Violet: It has taken damage and can no longer hold the head of its cloth disguise upright. For as long as it lives, Mimikyu will never forget its attacker.

Bruxish
Scarlet: It grinds its teeth with great force to stimulate its brain. It fires the psychic energy created by this process from the protuberance on its head.
Violet: When sunlight reflects on the ripples created by a Bruxish grinding its teeth, the water all around sparkles brilliantly.

Skwovet
Scarlet: It stores berries in its cheeks. When there are no berries to be found, Skwovet will stuff pebbles into its cheeks to stave off its cravings.
Violet: No matter how much it stuffs its belly with food, it is always anxious about getting hungry again. So, it stashes berries in its cheeks and tail.

Greedent
Scarlet: If it spots a berry tree, it will immediately go to gather berries without a sideways glanceÑeven if itÕs in the middle of a battle.
Violet: This PokŽmon makes off with heaps of fallen berries by wrapping them in its tail, which is roughly twice the length of its body.

Rookidee
Scarlet: This PokŽmon is brave and reckless. The white markings around a RookideeÕs eyes intimidate fainthearted PokŽmon.
Violet: The females are fussier than the males. If another creature dirties a female RookideeÕs wings, itÕll peck the offender relentlessly in a burning rage.

Corvisquire
Scarlet: ItÕs said that the reason behind CorvisquireÕs high level of intelligence is the large size of its brain relative to those of other bird PokŽmon.
Violet: This intelligent PokŽmon will quickly learn how to use any tool it can hold in its beak or its talons.

Corviknight
Scarlet: Corviknight canÕt serve as a taxi service in Paldea because the PokŽmonÕs natural predators will attack it while it flies, endangering the customer.
Violet: Although its wings have partly turned to steel and become heavy as a result, this PokŽmon flies through the skies with ease.

Chewtle
Scarlet: Its large front tooth is still growing in. When the tooth itches, this PokŽmon will bite another ChewtleÕs horn, and the two PokŽmon will tussle.
Violet: A popular game among children is to lift up sticks that Chewtle have bitten onto to see whose Chewtle can hang on the longest.

Drednaw
Scarlet: Its massive, jagged teeth can crush a boulder in a single bite. This PokŽmon has an extremely vicious disposition.
Violet: Drednaw lurks along the shoreline. When prey come to drink water, Drednaw stretches its neck out and chomps down on them.

Rolycoly
Scarlet: On sunny days, Rolycoly will come out onto grassy plains and roll around. Then it will eat the grass that gets tangled in its wheel-like leg.
Violet: Chunks of the surface of this PokŽmonÕs body that have grown old and flaked off have long been used for fuel as an alternative to coal.

Carkol
Scarlet: The temperature inside its body increases when it experiences strong emotions. It rolls around frantically while spewing flames.
Violet: Due to the coal tar created inside it, the heap of coal on CarkolÕs back never falls apart, even when the PokŽmon rolls around at high speeds.

Coalossal
Scarlet: To intimidate its opponents, Coalossal will vigorously shake its body, scattering coal from its smoldering back.
Violet: ItÕs gentle usually but fearsome when angered. With a body that burns at over 2,700 degrees Fahrenheit, it crushes foes and turns them to ash.

Applin
Scarlet: It grows by eating the flesh of an apple. Applin uses its own body fluid to strengthen the appleÕs skin and prevent it from rotting.
Violet: Applin lives inside an apple. When an Applin is separated from its apple, its body loses moisture and the PokŽmon grows weak.

Flapple
Scarlet: It flutters around while seeking an opening in the opponentÕs guard, then attacks by spitting acidic liquid strong enough to melt metal.
Violet: It uses its own body fluid to repair its apple. Strong Flapple that have won many battles have apples that are clay colored all over.

Appletun
Scarlet: It feeds mainly on sweet apples. It will also eat small bug PokŽmon that are attracted by its sweet nectar.
Violet: When some Lechonk come along to lick the sweet nectar on AppletunÕs back, Appletun will spew sticky nectar at them to drive them away.

Silicobra
Scarlet: SilicobraÕs neck pouch, which can inflate and deflate like a balloon, gets more elastic each time Silicobra sheds its skin.
Violet: SilicobraÕs large nostrils are specialized for spraying sand, so this PokŽmon is not very good at telling apart different smells.

Sandaconda
Scarlet: It will expand its body as much as it can and then contract itself, blasting out sand with enough force to wash away a dump truck.
Violet: The sand it spews contains sharp, pointy gravel, which is actually just sand that SandacondaÕs saliva has hardened into irregular shapes.

Arrokuda
Scarlet: Arrokuda can swim quickly only in a straight line. The ones that become sluggish from overeating are the first to be targeted by flocks of Wattrel.
Violet: It takes down prey by charging into them with its hard, pointed jaw. But ArrokudaÕs eyesight is poor, so this tactic has a low success rate.

Barraskewda
Scarlet: It spins its tail fins to leap from the water, then viciously bites down on Wingull flying close to the waterÕs surface.
Violet: It swims at speeds of over 100 knots and battles fiercely with pods of Finizen over prey.

Toxel
Scarlet: It has no problem drinking dirty water. An organ inside ToxelÕs body filters such water into a poisonous liquid that is harmless to Toxel.
Violet: This selfish, attention-seeking PokŽmon stores poison and electricity in two different sacs inside its body.

Toxtricity (Amped Form)
Scarlet: As it scatters toxic sweat and emits electricity, a melody that sounds like it came from a guitar reverberates through the surrounding area.
Violet: The jolts of electricity it launches by violently strumming the protrusions on its chest easily exceed 15,000 volts.

Toxtricity (Low Key Form)
Scarlet: Many youths admire the way this PokŽmon listlessly picks fights and keeps its cool no matter what opponent it faces.
Violet: As it gulps down stagnant water and generates electricity in its body, a sound like a rhythm played by a bass guitar reverberates all around.

Sinistea (Phony Form)
Scarlet: The soul of someone who died alone possessed some leftover tea. This PokŽmon appears in hotels and houses.
Violet: Sinistea gets into your body when you drink it, and then it steals your vitality from within. It also tastes awful.

Sinistea (Antique Form)
Scarlet: Some fanatics will go to great pains to prepare the perfect tea and teacup, eagerly waiting for a Sinistea to come and possess their selections.
Violet: This Sinistea lives in an antique teacup. As valuable as this PokŽmon is, its awful taste remains unchanged.

Polteageist (Phony Form)
Scarlet: The tea that composes PolteageistÕs body has a distinct and enjoyable flavor. Drinking too much, however, can be fatal.
Violet: These PokŽmon multiply by creeping into teapots and pouring themselves into leftover tea.

Polteageist (Antique Form)
Scarlet: Apparently a PolteageistÕs disposition is affected by the type of tea the PokŽmon came from. What teapot it inhabits makes no difference.
Violet: Though risky to drink, this PokŽmonÕs tea tastes delicious. Gourmets who have no fear of danger drink Polteageist tea day after day.

Hatenna
Scarlet: Because the emotions of others constantly flow into its head, this PokŽmon prefers environments where no other creatures live.
Violet: It senses the feelings of other living creatures. Be careful not to expose it to strong emotions for too long, or it will end up exhausted.

Hattrem
Scarlet: To this PokŽmon, strong emotions apparently feel like incredibly loud noisesÑeven if the emotions are happy ones.
Violet: The moment this PokŽmon finds someone whoÕs emitting strong emotions, it will pummel them senseless with its braids to silence them.

Hatterene
Scarlet: Hatterene knocks out those that intrude in its home forest by blasting them with a beam, then slashing with claws enhanced by psychic power.
Violet: Beware of forests that show no signs of living creatures within. You may have wandered into HattereneÕs territory.

Impidimp
Scarlet: The reason this PokŽmon causes trouble for those it feels close to is because Impidimp itself gets irritable if it canÕt absorb negative emotions.
Violet: They live in groups, pestering and playing pranks on each other to polish their troublemaking skills.

Morgrem
Scarlet: Morgrem prefers dirty tactics, like ambushing, because it doesnÕt have confidence in its brawn.
Violet: This PokŽmon absorbs negative emotions and turns them into energy. ItÕs popular with people who tend to think gloomy thoughts.

Grimmsnarl
Scarlet: This PokŽmon has complete control over its hair. Grimmsnarl normally keeps its hair wrapped around its body to support its muscles.
Violet: It lives deep within the forest. Even after evolving into this splendid form, it hasnÕt given up on its petty misdeeds and pranks.

Falinks
Scarlet: The brass, which is the one that stands at the front and issues orders, is the strongest and smartest of the six.
Violet: The leader, known as the brass, uses its extendible horn to issue orders to the others when itÕs time to change formation.

Pincurchin
Scarlet: This PokŽmon generates electricity when it digests food. It uses its five hard teeth to scrape seaweed off surfaces and eat it.
Violet: This PokŽmon is so timid that even brushing against seaweed will make it discharge electricity in surprise. Its lips do not conduct electricity.

Snom
Scarlet: It eats snow that has accumulated on the ground. It prefers soft, freshly fallen snow, so it will eat its way up a mountain, aiming for the peak.
Violet: Within its internal organs, Snom amplifies the frigid air it gets from eating snow and then uses this amplified air to create icicle-like spikes.

Frosmoth
Scarlet: Frosmoth senses air currents with its antennae. It sends its scales drifting on frigid air, making them fall like snow.
Violet: It causes blizzards as it flies around with its huge, chill-emanating wings. Clean meltwater is its favorite thing to drink.

Stonjourner
Scarlet: The elemental composition of the rocks that form its body were found to match the bedrock of a land far away from this PokŽmonÕs habitat.
Violet: This PokŽmon spends its life gazing at the setting sun. It strides leisurely across grassy plains on legs of rock that weigh over 400 pounds each.

Eiscue (Ice Face)
Scarlet: On hot days, these PokŽmon press their ice cube heads together and pass the time cooling each other down.
Violet: If you lick the ice covering its face, youÕll find it has a faintly salty taste. This species rode here on ocean currents from a cold, faraway land.

Eiscue (Noice Face)
Scarlet: The ice that was covering this EiscueÕs face has shattered. Eiscue emits cold air from the tip of its hair to protect its head, which is sensitive to heat.
Violet: Contrary to its looks, Eiscue is a poor swimmer. It creates ice balls at the tip of its single hair to lure prey in and fish them up.

Indeedee (Male)
Scarlet: This PokŽmon picks up on the positive emotions of other creatures via its horns and uses those emotions to fuel itself.
Violet: This PokŽmon never leaves its TrainerÕs side. It predicts their actions with its psychic power and takes care of their day-to-day needs.

Indeedee (Female)
Scarlet: It dislikes conflict. If a fight occurs in its territory, it uses psychic power to throw things at the combatants in an effort to drive them away.
Violet: In search of happy feelingsÑsuch as joy and gratitudeÑIndeedee bustles around, taking diligent care of people and other PokŽmon.

Cufant
Scarlet: Using the pointy tip of its trunk, it carves off chunks of hard rocks to eat. It is very docile and helps people with physical labor.
Violet: Cufant can lift loads weighing five tons. In the mornings, it heads into caves with its herd, in search of the ore on which these PokŽmon feed.

Copperajah
Scarlet: This PokŽmon was brought to Paldea long ago by people from a faraway land. ItÕs so strong that it can easily pull an airplane.
Violet: Copperajah are prideful, cantankerous PokŽmon. Specimens with vibrant green skin command the respect of others of their kind.

Dreepy
Scarlet: In the evening, groups of Dreepy will fly at high speeds over the ocean and poke at PokŽmon in the water for fun.
Violet: It has a habit of biting at Clauncher even though it doesnÕt feed on them. This is said to be vestigial behavior from when Dreepy was alive.

Drakloak
Scarlet: This PokŽmon flies around at over 120 miles per hour. If a Drakloak is defeated in a battle, its Dreepy will wander off without a second thought.
Violet: This PokŽmon stores up energy in its lungs, then shoots it out. It takes care of Dreepy and battles alongside them until theyÕre all grown up.

Dragapult
Scarlet: Dragapult can make its whole body transparent by clearing its mind and focusing. Even the Dreepy in DragapultÕs horns become invisible.
Violet: The fastest Dragapult of the group is always surrounded by Dreepy that want to fly at sonic speed.

Sprigatito
Scarlet: Its fluffy fur is similar in composition to plants. This PokŽmon frequently washes its face to keep it from drying out.
Violet: The sweet scent its body gives off mesmerizes those around it. The scent grows stronger when this PokŽmon is in the sun.

Floragato
Scarlet: Floragato deftly wields the vine hidden beneath its long fur, slamming the hard flower bud against its opponents.
Violet: The hardness of FloragatoÕs fur depends on the PokŽmonÕs mood. When Floragato is prepared to battle, its fur becomes pointed and needle sharp.

Meowscarada
Scarlet: This PokŽmon uses the reflective fur lining its cape to camouflage the stem of its flower, creating the illusion that the flower is floating.
Violet: With skillful misdirection, it rigs foes with pollen-packed flower bombs. Meowscarada sets off the bombs before its foes realize whatÕs going on.

Fuecoco
Scarlet: It lies on warm rocks and uses the heat absorbed by its square-shaped scales to create fire energy.
Violet: Its flame sac is small, so energy is always leaking out. This energy is released from the dent atop FuecocoÕs head and flickers to and fro.

Crocalor
Scarlet: The combination of CrocalorÕs fire energy and overflowing vitality has caused an egg-shaped fireball to appear on the PokŽmonÕs head.
Violet: The valve in CrocalorÕs flame sac is closely connected to its vocal cords. This PokŽmon utters a guttural cry as it spews flames every which way.

Skeledirge
Scarlet: The fiery bird changes shape when Skeledirge sings. Rumor has it that the bird was born when the fireball on SkeledirgeÕs head gained a soul.
Violet: SkeledirgeÕs gentle singing soothes the souls of all that hear it. It burns its enemies to a crisp with flames of over 5,400 degrees Fahrenheit.

Quaxly
Scarlet: This PokŽmon migrated to Paldea from distant lands long ago. The gel secreted by its feathers repels water and grime.
Violet: Its strong legs let it easily swim around in even fast-flowing rivers. It likes to keep things tidy and is prone to overthinking things.

Quaxwell
Scarlet: These PokŽmon constantly run through shallow waters to train their legs, then compete with each other to see which of them kicks most gracefully.
Violet: The hardworking Quaxwell observes people and PokŽmon from various regions and incorporates their movements into its own dance routines.

Quaquaval
Scarlet: A single kick from a Quaquaval can send a truck rolling. This PokŽmon uses its powerful legs to perform striking dances from far-off lands.
Violet: Dancing in ways that evoke far-away places, this PokŽmon mesmerizes all that see it. Flourishes of its decorative water feathers slice into its foes.

Lechonk
Scarlet: It searches for food all day. It possesses a keen sense of smell but doesnÕt use it for anything other than foraging.
Violet: This PokŽmon spurns all but the finest of foods. Its body gives off an herblike scent that bug PokŽmon detest.

Oinkologne (Male)
Scarlet: Oinkologne is proud of its fine, glossy skin. It emits a concentrated scent from the tip of its tail.
Violet: It entrances female PokŽmon with the sweet, alluring scent that wafts from all over its body.

Oinkologne (Female)
Scarlet: This PokŽmon sends a flowerlike scent wafting about. Well-developed muscles in its legs allow it to leap more than 16 feet with no trouble at all.
Violet: This is a meticulous PokŽmon that likes to keep things tidy. It shrouds itself in a floral aroma that soothes the PokŽmon around it.

Tarountula
Scarlet: The ball of threads wrapped around its body is elastic enough to deflect the scythes of Scyther, this PokŽmonÕs natural enemy.
Violet: The thread it secretes from its rear is as strong as wire. The secret behind the threadÕs strength is the topic of ongoing research.

Spidops
Scarlet: It clings to branches and ceilings using its threads and moves without a sound. It takes out its prey before the prey even notices it.
Violet: Spidops covers its territory in tough, sticky threads to set up traps for intruders.

Nymble
Scarlet: It has its third set of legs folded up. When itÕs in a tough spot, this PokŽmon jumps over 30 feet using the strength of its legs.
Violet: ItÕs highly skilled at a fighting style in which it uses its jumping capabilities to dodge incoming attacks while also dealing damage to opponents.

Lokix
Scarlet: When it decides to fight all out, it stands on its previously folded legs to enter Showdown Mode. It neutralizes its enemies in short order.
Violet: It uses its normally folded third set of legs when in Showdown Mode. This places a huge burden on its body, so it canÕt stay in this mode for long.

Pawmi
Scarlet: It has underdeveloped electric sacs on its cheeks. These sacs can produce electricity only if Pawmi rubs them furiously with the pads on its forepaws.
Violet: The pads of its paws are electricity-discharging organs. Pawmi fires electricity from its forepaws while standing unsteadily on its hind legs.

Pawmo
Scarlet: When its group is attacked, Pawmo is the first to leap into battle, defeating enemies with a fighting technique that utilizes electric shocks.
Violet: Pawmo uses a unique fighting technique in which it uses its forepaws to strike foes and zap them with electricity from its paw pads simultaneously.

Pawmot
Scarlet: This PokŽmon normally is slow to react, but once it enters battle, it will strike down its enemies with lightning-fast movements.
Violet: PawmotÕs fluffy fur acts as a battery. It can store the same amount of electricity as an electric car.

Tandemaus
Scarlet: Exhibiting great teamwork, they use their incisors to cut pieces out of any material that might be useful for a nest, then make off with them.
Violet: The pair sticks together no matter what. They split any food they find exactly in half and then eat it together.

Violet: The little one just appeared one day. They all live together like a family, but the relationship between the three is still unclear.

Fidough
Scarlet: This PokŽmon is smooth and moist to the touch. Yeast in FidoughÕs breath induces fermentation in the PokŽmonÕs vicinity.
Violet: The yeast in FidoughÕs breath is useful for cooking, so this PokŽmon has been protected by people since long ago.

Dachsbun
Scarlet: The pleasant aroma that emanates from this PokŽmonÕs body helps wheat grow, so Dachsbun has been treasured by farming villages.
Violet: The surface of this PokŽmonÕs skin hardens when exposed to intense heat, and its body has an appetizing aroma.

Smoliv
Scarlet: It protects itself from enemies by emitting oil from the fruit on its head. This oil is bitter and astringent enough to make someone flinch.

Dolliv
Scarlet: Dolliv shares its tasty, fresh-scented oil with others. This species has coexisted with humans since times long gone.

Scarlet: The largest of their flocks can contain more than 50 individuals. They fly around towns and forests, searching for food and making a racket.

Squawkabilly (White Plumage)
Scarlet: This PokŽmon dislikes being alone. It has a strong sense of community and survives by cooperating with allies.
Violet: Though these Squawkabilly are the fewest in number, they have no trouble living in towns since they blend in with the white buildings.

Nacli
Scarlet: It was born in a layer of rock salt deep under the earth. This species was particularly treasured in the old days, as they would share precious salt.
Violet: The ground scrapes its body as it travels, causing it to leave salt behind. Salt is constantly being created and replenished inside NacliÕs body.

Naclstack
Scarlet: This PokŽmon dry cures its prey by spraying salt over them. The curing process steals away the water in the preyÕs body.

Ceruledge

Tadbulb
Scarlet: Tadbulb shakes its tail to generate electricity. If it senses danger, it will make its head blink on and off to alert its allies.
Violet: It floats using the electricity stored in its body. When thunderclouds are around, Tadbulb will float higher off the ground.

Bellibolt

Violet: What appear to be eyeballs are actually organs for discharging the electricity generated by BelliboltÕs belly-button dynamo.

Wattrel
Scarlet: When its wings catch the wind, the bones within produce electricity. This PokŽmon dives into the ocean, catching prey by electrocuting them.
Violet: These PokŽmon make their nests on coastal cliffs. The nests have a strange, crackling texture, and theyÕre a popular delicacy.

Kilowattrel
Scarlet: Kilowattrel inflates its throat sac to amplify its electricity. By riding the wind, this PokŽmon can fly over 430 miles in a day.
Violet: It uses its throat sac to store electricity generated by its wings. ThereÕs hardly any oil in its feathers, so it is a poor swimmer.

Maschiff
Scarlet: It always scowls in an attempt to make opponents take it seriously, but even crying children will burst into laughter when they see MaschiffÕs face.
Violet: Its well-developed jaw and fangs are strong enough to crunch through boulders, and its thick fat makes for an excellent defense.

Grafaiai

Bramblin
Scarlet: A soul unable to move on to the afterlife was blown around by the wind until it got tangled up with dried grass and became a PokŽmon.
Violet: Not even Bramblin knows where it is headed as it tumbles across the wilderness, blown by the wind. It loathes getting wet.

Brambleghast
Scarlet: It will open the branches of its head to envelop its prey. Once it absorbs all the life energy it needs, it expels the prey and discards it.

Toedscool

Toedscruel
Scarlet: These PokŽmon gather into groups and form colonies deep within forests. They absolutely hate it when strangers approach.

Klawf
Scarlet: Klawf hangs upside-down from cliffs, waiting for prey. But Klawf canÕt remain in this position for long because its blood rushes to its head.
Violet: This PokŽmon lives on sheer cliffs. It sidesteps opponentsÕ attacks, then lunges for their weak spots with its claws.

Capsakid
Scarlet: The more sunlight this PokŽmon bathes in, the more spicy chemicals are produced by its body, and thus the spicier its moves become.
Violet: Traditional Paldean dishes can be extremely spicy because they include the shed front teeth of Capsakid among their ingredients.

Scovillain
Scarlet: The red head converts spicy chemicals into fire energy and blasts the surrounding area with a super spicy stream of flame.
Violet: The green head has turned vicious due to the spicy chemicals stimulating its brain. Once it goes on a rampage, there is no stopping it.

Rellor
Scarlet: This PokŽmon creates a mud ball by mixing sand and dirt with psychic energy. It treasures its mud ball more than its own life.
Violet: It rolls its mud ball around while the energy it needs for evolution matures. Eventually the time comes for it to evolve.

Rabsca
Scarlet: The body that supports the ball barely moves. Therefore, it is thought that the true body of this PokŽmon is actually inside the ball.
Violet: An infant sleeps inside the ball. Rabsca rolls the ball soothingly with its legs to ensure the infant sleeps comfortably.

Flittle
Scarlet: FlittleÕs toes levitate about half an inch above the ground because of the psychic power emitted from the frills on the PokŽmonÕs belly.
Violet: It spends its time running around wastelands. If anyone steals its beloved berries, it will chase them down and exact its revenge.

Wiglett
Scarlet: This PokŽmon can pick up the scent of a Veluza just over 65 feet away and will hide itself in the sand.
Violet: Though it looks like Diglett, Wiglett is an entirely different species. The resemblance seems to be a coincidental result of environmental adaptation.

Wugtrio
Scarlet: It has a vicious temperament, contrary to what its appearance may suggest. It wraps its long bodies around prey, then drags the prey into its den.
Violet: A variety of fish PokŽmon, Wugtrio was once considered to be a regional form of Dugtrio.

Bombirdier
Scarlet: It gathers things up in an apron made from shed feathers added to the PokŽmonÕs chest feathers, then drops those things from high places for fun.

Violet: The steel section is VaroomÕs actual body. This PokŽmon clings to rocks and converts the minerals within into energy to fuel its activities.

Revavroom
Scarlet: It creates a gas out of poison and minerals from rocks. It then detonates the gas in its cylindersÑ now numbering eightÑto generate energy.
Violet: Revavroom viciously threatens others with the sound of its exhaust. It sticks its tongue out from its cylindrical mouth and sprays toxic fluids.

Cyclizar
Scarlet: Apparently Cyclizar has been allowing people to ride on its back since ancient times. Depictions of this have been found in 10,000-year-old murals.
